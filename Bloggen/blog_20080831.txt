Today it's going back home, home to germany. let's see if 
locate it stays the "home" for me or changes. the flight has a 30 
minutes delay because of technical problems. lets 
hope i get my bus connection which seems to be impossible 
at the moment. well, this 
can remind someone to some of the airplane crashes in the 
last time. but at the moment i'm sitting in the plane and 
this is in the air. so only the landing can become a 
peoblem. this is the first time i go to airport 
Baden Baden. this should be muxh less stressfull since i 
can fly at noon and not early in the morning or late at 
night.  
but of course you pay the price elsewhere. ive 
never seen so many kids in an airplane and of 
course they all want to vieit the toilet; me 

sitting in the front: no tood idea. 
leaving the flat was not so much of a 
problem, 
since i'll come back soon and everything went alright with 
the university. and i have my new phony :-) 
and immediately i get stressy feeling aince i have to 
prepare a presentation until wednesday and a apeech for 
saturday, prepare a present for the wedding and by the way 
learning for the oral exam.
