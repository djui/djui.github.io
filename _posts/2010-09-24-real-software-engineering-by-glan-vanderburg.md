Assumptions once were true, but no longer:
 * Code is hard to read
 * Code is hard to change
 * Testing is expensive

Assumptions once believed, but never true:
 * All engineering is like structural engineering
 * Programming is like building
 * Modeling and analysis are about correctness

The reality of Software Engineering
 * Software is very unlike bridges and buildings
 * Additional complexity hinders requirements, design, and approval
 * Source code _is_ a model
 * Building and testing our interim designs is effectively free
 * Empirical processes are rational for software

Growing up
 * Not math
 * Not models
 * Not documents
 * Not copying other disciplines

Growing up
 * Learn from practitioners
 * Bias toward empirical processes
 * Encourage continued innovation
 * Call what works "engineering"
 * Today software engineering is called "ale"
